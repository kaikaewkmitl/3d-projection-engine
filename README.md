# KMITL C Programming Project: 3D Projection Engine 

## Proposal Structure
The proposal will include the following sections:
* Project Title: 3D Projection Engine 
* Description: This program (1.) projects a 3D illusion into a 2D plane (2.) by drawing inclined or declined lines from  coordinates or vertices in a certain angle from a perspective point (3.) to make a 3D object for detailed method please read the detail below.


## Detailed Description:
* Checkpoint (1.) \
We first need a console engine that creates a 'blank' window application from win32 api,directx or any other optional libary in order to show us the output/result and serve us as a GUI for example olcgameengine window which is made up of 6base number 6x6 array in which each array is translated from a coordinate(x,y) with the following formula: 
array[i] = y *(i in range (x,y)) + x 
* Checkpoint (2.)\
Next we need a base engine from any graphical libary composed of functions that has a mathematics formula that receives our parameter/input and logic to translate the variable and calculate the "object" and  "projection" output for us. For more detail about the method please read the documentation provided below.
* Checkpoint (3.)\
Finally we can observe the outcome from our designated "perspective", also we can make the object dynamic by constantly updating its position precisely using "matrix rotation" and mathematics.
* Room for improvement \
Additionally a camera can be made by constantly updating our "perspective" upon WASD input thus ray-casting and ray-tracing is possible to make up a viable first person game also we can add texture to the object or import a texture by reading a FILE which contains our desired parameter(input) in a specified format.
