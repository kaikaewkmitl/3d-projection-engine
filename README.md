# C Programming Project Proposal

## Proposal Structure
The proposal will include the following sections:
* Project Title: 3D Projection Engine 
* Description: This program (1.) projects a 3D illusion into a 2D plane (2.) by drawing inclined or declined lines from  coordinates or vertices in a certain angle from a perspective point (3.) to make a 3D object.


## Description:
* Checkpoint (1.) \
* \
We first need a console engine that creates a window application from win32 api,directx or any other optional libary in order to show us the output/result.
* Checkpoint (2.)\
* \
Next we need a base engine from any graphical libary composed of functions that has a mathematics formula that receives our parameter/input and logic to calculate the "object" and  "projection" output for us. For more detail about the method please read the documentation provided below.
* Checkpoint (3.)\
Finally we can observe the outcome from our designated "perspective", also we can make the object dynamic by constantly updating its position precisely using "matrix rotation" and mathematics additionally  a first person camera is posible by constantly updating our "perspective" upon WASD input.
